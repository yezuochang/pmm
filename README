pmm is a Matlab toolbox for passive macro-modeling from frequency-domain (measured or EM-simulated) tabulated data, such as S-parameter data. It takes industrial-standard touchstone format file as input, and generate state-space model in circuit netlist format which can be used in commercial SPICE simulator for doing all types of analyses. It composes of different state-of-the-art modeling techniques, and it is designed to be extensible, i.e. new methods can be easily plugged into the flow.

1. Run pmm_setup.m first
2. Run [G,W,F,H]=pmm(infile, q, opts);

See demo/demo.m for getting start.
